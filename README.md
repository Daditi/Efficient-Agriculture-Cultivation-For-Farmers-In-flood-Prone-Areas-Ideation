### Title
Efficient Agriculture cultivation For Farmers In Flood Prone Areas Ideation

### Background Context
For centuries, the fertile lands surrounding the Shannon River have sustained farming communities, shaping not only the basin’s economy but also its culture and environment. Yet today, these same farmlands stand at the center of pressing challenges. Agricultural intensification has increased nutrient runoff, fueling algal blooms that choke waterways and diminish biodiversity. Seasonal flooding, a natural feature of the Shannon, is growing more unpredictable with climate change, threatening crops, livelihoods and the delicate balance between land and water. Farmers who form the backbone of the basin’s rural communities, often lack timely, localized information to adapt their practices in ways that protect both their yields and the river’s health.
Against this backdrop, space-enabled technologies open up transformative possibilities. Satellite missions such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (Copernicus), Landsat and radar-based Earth observations offer unparalleled perspectives on soil moisture, vegetation health and flood extent—even through Ireland’s often cloud-covered skies. When combined with high-resolution weather forecasts, soil databases, and the power of artificial intelligence, these data streams can be translated into actionable insights: where and when to sow, how much to irrigate, when to avoid fertilizer use or which fields are at risk of flooding.
Such a system would not only support farmers in making informed, sustainable decisions but also contribute to broader goals of water conservation, ecosystem restoration and climate resilience. In doing so, the Shannon River Basin could become a living laboratory where local knowledge and advanced technology converge to pioneer solutions with global relevance.

### Problem Framing (The Guiding Question)
How might we design an AI powered crop advisory system that leverages satellite data, weather forecasts and local soil information to provide farmers in the Shannon River Basin with timely, accessible, and sustainable recommendations and disaster manangement techniques for crop planning, irrigation and fertilizer use while mitigating flooding risks and protecting river ecosystems?

### Expected Outcomes (Examples, not Prescriptions)
Visual maps highlighting flood-prone or nutrient stressed zones in farms.
AI models predicting optimal sowing dates, input needs, and potential yield.
Chatbot assistant to make advice accessible to farmers with limited digital literacy.
Framework for scaling to other river basins or farming communities.
An interface based prototype delivering real time crop and flood advisories.

### Difficulty
Intermediate, Advanced

### Scope
Included:
Dataset (satellite, weather, soil datasets).
AI/ML models for crop, yield, and flood prediction.
Farmer eccentric communication interface (app, web, chatbot).

Excluded:
